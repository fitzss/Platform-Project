# Platform-Project
A project about building a platform based on Kubernetes and enabling cloud-native features.

I am going to implement a platform based off the knowledege and skills I have learned from the Cloud Native Developer Bootcamp, LearnK8S Academy, and "Platform Engineering on Kubernetes" book.  

In this project I am going to implement an internal platform for data science developers.  Who are working on a computer-vision microservice.  This platform will consist of muliple microservices that need to be managed to their own discretion.  I will have a front-end service, data-base-service, and ml service being deployed.
