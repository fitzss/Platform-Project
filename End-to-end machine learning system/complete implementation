Following and implementing myself the project from the last chapter of @TerryTangYuan book "Distributed Machine Machine Patterns".

Implementing an end-to-end machine learning system by an architecture Terry designed, also doing a complete implementation to each of the components that incorporate the patterns described in the book, and using several popular frameworks and cutting-edge technologies, particularly TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Docker, and Argo Workflows. All toosl used to build different components of a distributed machine learning workflows.
